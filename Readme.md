I've produced 4 scrits for the graphs, 1 for each, and 1 script that reads in 
data from disk.

My graphs are meant to be as close to those published in the instructions as 
possible.  A small difficulty was found in the legend of plot 4, and so I 
shortened the names of the lables to sub 1, etc.
